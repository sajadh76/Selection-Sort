# Selection-sort
In this project, a random number generator feeds the selection sort algorithm with 1000 random numbers. Then, the selection sort algorithm sorts the generated numbers and prints the sorted numbers. Moreover, this project calculates the sorting time to compare it with other algorithms and other languages.
You must use MARS assembler to assemble this project.
