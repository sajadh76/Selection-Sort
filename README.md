# MIPS Assembly - Randomized Selection Sort
This project, created as part of my bachelor's degree in computer architecture, showcases the implementation of the selection sort algorithm in MIPS assembly language. The algorithm is fed with 1000 randomly generated numbers using a random number generator.

# Overview
Random Number Generation:
Utilizes a random number generator in MIPS assembly to generate 1000 random numbers.
The generator is seeded using the system time to ensure randomness.

Selection Sort Algorithm:
Implements the selection sort algorithm to efficiently sort the generated random numbers.
The sorting process is done in-place within the MIPS assembly code.

Sorting Time Calculation:
Measures the time taken to perform the sorting using a timer based on system time.
This time measurement is used to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the selection sort algorithm.
Instructions

# To assemble and run this project
Use the MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) assembler.
Open the provided MIPS assembly code in MARS.
Execute the program to generate random numbers, perform selection sort, and calculate the sorting time.
